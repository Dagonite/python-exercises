Repository for my Python exercises

Requirements
---
Most of the worksheets will require John Zelle's simple object-oriented graphics library [graphics.py](https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py) to work. To install the library, enter the following into a command-line interpreter (will require pip to be installed as well):

```
pip install graphics.py
```

Alternatively, download it from the above link and place it somewhere Python can find it, e.g. `Lib/site-packages`.

Repository for my Python exercises

Requirements
---
A few files will require John Zelle's simple object oriented graphics library [graphics.py](https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py) to work. To install the library, enter the following into a command-line interpreter (will require pip to be installed as well):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure the library is installed somewhere Python can find it, e.g. `Lib/site-packages`.
